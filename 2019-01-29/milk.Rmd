## The Data

Data this week comes from the USDA (United States Department of Agriculture)! The raw datasets (Excel Sheets) can be found [here](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/dairy-data/documentation/#Loc3). There is even more data at the source if you are interested, much of which requires a LOT of `fun` Excel sheet data munging.



```{r}
production <- read_csv("milkcow_facts.csv")
```
