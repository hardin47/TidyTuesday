## The Data

For Deepsha Menghani's talk on [Data Viz animation and interactivity in Quarto](https://deepshamenghani.github.io/posit_plotly_crosstalk/#/title-slide), she watched each episode of Ted Lasso at 2X speed and diligently noted down every F*bomb and gesture reference, and then made it into the [richmondway R package](https://github.com/deepshamenghani/richmondway)!


```{r}
richmondway <- read.csv("richmondway.csv") |>
  janitor::clean_names()
```

## Exploring

```{r}
#| fig-cap: The first episode of the season is rated much lower than the last episode of the season for each of the three seasons (delineated by blue vertical lines).

  ggplot(aes(x = episode_order, y = imdb_rating)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 10.5, color = "blue") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 22.5, color = "blue")
```


## Roy Kent

```{r}
p1 <- richmondway |>
  mutate(f_count_else = f_count_total - f_count_rk) |>
  pivot_longer(cols = c(`f_count_rk`,`f_count_else`), names_to = "who", values_to = "count") |>
  mutate(who = ifelse(who == "f_count_rk", "Roy Kent", "someone else")) |>
  mutate(count = ifelse(who == "Roy Kent", -count, count)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = episode_order, y = count, fill = imdb_rating)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 0.8) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 10.5, color = "black") + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 22.5, color = "black") +

  coord_flip() +
  scale_fill_gradient(high = "red", low = "darkblue") + 
  labs(x = "", y = "",
       fill = "IMDB rating")

p2 <- cowplot::add_sub(p1, "F**k count, Roy Kent | F**k count, everyone else", hjust = 0.54)
cowplot::ggdraw(p2)

p3 <- cowplot::add_sub(p2)

cowplot::ggdraw(p3)
