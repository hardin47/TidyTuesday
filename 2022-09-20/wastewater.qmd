## The Data

The data this week on wastewater plants comes from [Macedo et al, 2022](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/HydroWASTE_version_1_0/14847786/1) by way of [Data is Plural](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2022-05-04-edition/).

```{r}
wwtp <- read_csv("HydroWASTE_v10.csv") %>%
  clean_names()
```


Dilution factor is the ratio of concentration in the effluent to concentration in the receiving water after missing in the receiving water.
(From: https://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2011/5136/pdf/sir20115136.pdf)

$$DF = \frac{Q_p + Q_e}{Q_e}$$
where $Q_p$ is the flow in the stream and $Q_e$ is the flow of the effluent.
I had originally thought that $Q_p$ is measured by `river_dis` and $Q_e$ is measured by `waste_dis`.
But that ratio doesn't give the same value as `df` in the dataset.
In the histograms below, notice how different the scaling is.


```{r}
wwtp <- wwtp %>%
  mutate(dil_fac = (river_dis + waste_dis) / waste_dis)

wwtp %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = dil_fac)) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log10") 

wwtp %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = df)) + 
  geom_histogram() +
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log10") 
```


## The worst plants

The dilution factor measures the ratio of water to discharge.  The lower the value, the more the water is being polluted.  Where are the worst treatment plants?

```{r}
world <- rnaturalearth::ne_countries(scale = "medium", returnclass = "sf") %>%
  select(iso_a3, geometry)

country_df <- wwtp %>%
  group_by(cntry_iso) %>%
  summarize(df_extent = sum(df < 10, na.rm = TRUE) / n())

df_fill <- left_join(country_df, world, by = c("cntry_iso" = "iso_a3"))
```


```{r}
#| fig-cap: Each country is colored by the proportion of treatment plants which have a dilution factor less than 10.  The points are the roughly 2500 waste water treatment plants with a dilution factor less than 10.  Some of the countries with the highest proportion of dilution factor less than 10 plants have very few plants.
#| fig-alt: World map plot with countries colored and points at the location for each waste water treatment plant with dilution factor less than 10.

  geom_sf(data = df_fill, aes(geometry = geometry, fill = df_extent),

             aes(x = lon_out, y = lat_out, color = df)) +

          color = guide_colorbar(title.position = "top",
