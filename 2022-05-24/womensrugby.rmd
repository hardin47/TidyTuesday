## The Data

The data on Women's Rugby comes from [ScrumQueens](https://www.scrumqueens.com/page/results-dashboard) by way of [Jacquie Tran](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/issues/439).


```{r}
fifteens <- read_csv("fifteens.csv")
sevens <- read_csv("sevens.csv")
```


## Over time

Are some countries better at sevens than fifteens?  Does it change over time?


```{r}
sevens_win <- sevens %>%
  mutate(year = year(date)) %>%
  mutate(decade = floor(year/10)*10) %>%
  group_by(decade, winner) %>%
  summarize(no_wins_7 = n()) %>%
  rename(country = winner)

sevens_loss <- sevens %>%
  mutate(year = year(date)) %>%
  mutate(decade = floor(year/10)*10) %>%
  group_by(decade, loser) %>%
  summarize(no_loss_7 = n()) %>%
  rename(country = loser)

sevens_win_loss <- sevens_win %>%
  full_join(sevens_loss, by = c("decade", "country")) %>%
  mutate(prop_win_7 = no_wins_7 / (no_wins_7 + no_loss_7))
  
```


```{r}

  mutate(year = year(date)) %>%
  mutate(decade = floor(year/10)*10) %>%
  group_by(decade, winner) %>%

fifteens_win_loss <- fifteens_win %>%
  full_join(fifteens_loss, by = c("decade", "country")) %>%
  mutate(prop_win_15 = no_wins_15 / (no_wins_15 + no_loss_15))
  
```

```{r}
win_loss <- fifteens_win_loss %>%
  full_join(sevens_win_loss, by = c("decade", "country")) %>%
  drop_na(prop_win_15, prop_win_7)
```

             xaxis = list(title = "sevens"),
             yaxis = list(title = "fifteens"))
```


```{r fig.cap = "Over time, are some countries more successful at sevens or fifteens?", fig.alt = "Scatterplot of countries (transitioning over time) with proportion of wins in sevens on the x-axis and proportion of wins in fifteens on the y-axis."}
